# Overview
Entrygen is a code generator for the nextgen fuzzer, which can be found at https://github.com/2trill2spill/nextgen.
Entrygen is used to generate the syscall entry files for nextgen.

# Build
First add the `entrygen` directory to your `GOPATH`. Next change directory into
the `entrygen` directory. Finally build with `go build entrygen.go`.

# Usage
To generate syscall entry files run `./entrygen -os platform`. Replace platform with operating system you want to build entry sources for. So to build entry sources for `FreeBSD` run `./entrygen -os freebsd`, or `./entrygen -os darwin` to build entry sources for `macOS`. If you leave off the `-os` option `entrygen` will build entry sources for the system it is running on.

# Design


# Bugs
If a bug is found in either the generator or it's documentation, open an issue in this repo's issue tracker. Warnings, errors and runtime bugs in generated code count as bugs in entrygen. Code generated by entrygen should compile with both `clang -Wall -Weverything -Werror` and `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
