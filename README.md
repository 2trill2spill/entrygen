# Bugs
If a bug is found in either the generator or it's documentation, open an issue in this repo's issue tracker. Warnings, errors and runtime bugs in generated code count as bugs in entrygen. Code generated by entrygen should compile with both `clang -Wall -Werror -Weverything` and `gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror`.
